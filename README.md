# Getting Data Course Project

## Overview
This repository contains the results for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The following sections describe how the course project script works and provide a code book describing the variables of the output data.

## Script Implementation
The implementation of run_analysis.R uses the dplyr library along with base R functionality to manipulate the input data.

A base assumption made by the script is that the data contains no missing values and that the number of records in the measurements, label and subject files fit to each other. This was verified using R and the source data

### Reading data
Data is read using the *read.table* function. Column labels for the measurements are generated by filtering the *features.txt* file for all columns having *mean()* or *std()* in them. Additional substitions normalize the feature column names into a CamelCase style.

Descriptive labels based on the *activity_labels.txt* are joined to each loaded data set. The subject keys are read from the respective files and are appended to the data sets.

From the test data sets the files 
* test/X_test.txt
* test/y_test.txt
* test/subject_test.txt

were loaded, combined and joined with the and activity labels.

From the training data sets the files 
* test/X_train.txt
* test/y_train.txt
* test/subject_train.txt

were loaded, combined and joined with the and activity labels.

### Naming and naming transformations
All names were transformed to apply to the widely used camel case notion starting with lowercase character. Especially regarding the long feature name I don't agree with using all lower case names without spaces as this does not contribute to readability.

The general transformation used for the mean and standard deviation features is to remove brackets, dashses and to convert into a camel case notation. For the output data set the mean prefix was added e.g.

      tBodyAcc-mean()-X -> tBodyAccMeanX -> meanTBodyAccMeanX

### Merging the test and training data sets
Both test and training data sets have the same column layout and can be combined into one data frame using the *union()* function of R.

### Generating the subject activity analysis data
To generate the output from the tidied data set dplyr in combination with pipes is used.

Together with grouping by subject key and activity the summarise_each function is used to apply the mean function to all feature measurements columns. A subsequent update of the column names indicate that they are mean values.

### Writing the results
The results are written out by the *write.table(..)* function to a file called *subjectActivityAnalysis.txt*

## Code book

The output data file is named *subjectActivityAnalysis.txt*

The file contains 180 rows and 68 columns.

The first two columns are group columns over which the means were created. All remaining columns contain means for the features in question.

Each record contains the means for all features in question and a specific activity done by an individual subject.

There are 30 subjects in total which participated all in the six different activities.

The following table provides a list of all columns in the data file.

| Column Name  | Type | Description |
